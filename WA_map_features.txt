IN WORK:



LINED UP:

Implement version control
--Embed the Polar plot in corner of map

--Ground tracks: please make the ground track TAIL gradient taper off more. 

--Update the "resize grid to fit earth" button so that the map goes to ZOOM level XXX and the canvas is resized to XXX.
--Enforce same styling on polar plot as in map (satellites are chevrons, satellite track gradient/head/tail, ....i dont like the arrows that are all over the orbit tracks..



Sensor Control Panel:



Main Control Panel:
--Add new Health control panel item
--Add new Messaging control panel item
--Add new Launch Site panel item


Profile Management:
--System logs need to specify which profile is logged in and stored for the last 48 hours 



Catalog:
--UDL integration
--SDA TAP Lab integration



Map:
--Add sensors via clicking on map
--display ships AIS
--display aircraft ADS-B
--display NOTAMs
--display 2x satellite nodal crossings
--Launch nominals and launch profiles



Polar Plot
--Add starfield to polar plot



Messaging:



Watch Lists:



Analysis:
--Update the Analysis control panel to be a table that is styled similarly to the other control panel tables....also need a way to select multiple analysis tools AND have some control over what panel they are assigned to.
--Gabbard
--Height v Time
--Monetgram
--RIC
--Mercator heatmap counting of objects/events

Pass Details, Time WIndow, Sensor, KOZ, Satellite, Pass, Proximity, RIC
Change "Time Window" to "Forecast Window"
Add a new analysis table call EO PEZ. 

On-click for NORAD, display Monet Gram
Designate Primary, Secondary targets


Debug color assignment when adding new satellites.
Debug deg/sec
Debug lunar arc, disappears when toggling primary/new satellites on or off
ISS default TLE, select pass from table that has moon above horizon with lunar arc
add new satellite

In the Pass Table, if more than 1 satellite is above horizon at the same time, then multiple rows are highlighted light green. Please update this so that 1. the satellite/row which rises first OR the row which user has selected will also have a bolded green top and bottom border. By default, have bolded borders applied to satellite which rises first, then if the user selects a different row, move bolded borders to that row instead.

Update Pass Table so by default it scrolls up/down to ensure current pass is displayed as new passes are added/removed from the table by other actions or as time elapses and a new pass becomes active.

It seems like the angular rate being calculated in the real time data display has an error. While I cannot prove where the discrepancy comes from, there are many examples where the Pass Table disagrees with Real Time data display. When I brush through a pass, the real time data display angular rate appears to fluctuate in ways that don't seems accurate.

SENSOR SELECT TABLE
1. Delete the text "Display Controls"
2. Move the "Time Window" controls below the polar plot, to the right of "Slider Step".
3. Remove the "Sensor Location / Keep Out" controls and *replace* those functions with a new table described below.
4. Move all of the tables up into the empty space we created.
5. *NEW TABLE* Create a "Sensor Selection" table that is similar to the *Satellite Selection* table.
---The "Sensor Selection" table should have a green "+" add button to create a new sensor row
---Upon adding a new sensor, a row should auto appear (expanded) in the table for user to input sensor Name, Lat, Lon, Sun KOZ (SKOZ), Moon KOZ (MKOZ), and Min Detectable Target (MDT). MDT is a value for a sensor indicating the dimmest object the sensor can detect (highest Visual Magnitude). 
---Include "Save" and "Cancel" buttons to confirm adding new sensor.
---Once a sensor is added, allow the user to select exactly 1 sensor from the table to populate the polar plot.
---Allow user to expand the row for each satellite in the table to edit text areas, save, delete, cancel.

Please render this file as an interactive artifact inline in chat. Copy the file directly to ensure it is not truncated and no bugs are introduced by attempting to recreate it.. Copy the complete file directly using bash since it's too large for a single create_file call:

Evaluate track quality:
Confirm sensor calibration tolerance (recency)
Confirm tracks are <3σ of reported calibration
Confirm pass geometry (max elevation, SNR, angular rate)
Confirm sufficient sensor probability of detection (Pd)
Confirm wind speed at sensor during pass

Check cross-tags: proximity events, ob spike, sensor LOS vector vs catalog

Reject outlier observations, reform tracks
Evaluate track "ASTAT" value
Evaluate track integrity, residual slope
For each subsequent track, iteratively evaluate state-update position position error
