Answer these questions:

1. **What went wrong?**
   - Mistakes made
   - False assumptions
   - Misestimates

2. **What took longer than expected?**
   - Unexpected complexity
   - Missing information
   - Tool/environment issues

3. **What would I do differently?**
   - Better approaches discovered
   - Process improvements
   - Earlier decisions to reconsider

4. **What went well?**
   - Successful patterns
   - Effective tools/techniques
   - Good decisions

5. **What did I learn?**
   - New technical knowledge
   - Domain insights
   - Process improvements

### Step 3: Document in LESSONS.md
Add findings using the existing format in LESSONS.md.

### Step 4: Identify Preventive Actions
- Are there similar bugs waiting to happen?
- Should a new test be added?
- Does AI_GOVERNOR.md need updates?

**Key Principle**: Document before forgetting.
