description: Initialize WA_map session with AI Governor compliance

## Session Initialization for WA_map

Before any work on this project, complete the following initialization sequence:

### Step 1: Read Governance Framework
Read C:\Users\seanp\Workspace\WA_map\AI_GOVERNOR.md

### Step 2: Confirm Mandatory Behaviors
List all 7 mandatory behaviors from the Quick Reference table and confirm compliance.

### Step 3: Read Current Project State
Read the following files in parallel:
- C:\Users\seanp\Workspace\WA_map\PLAN.md (active work)
- C:\Users\seanp\Workspace\WA_map\BUGS.md (open issues)
- C:\Users\seanp\Workspace\WA_map\FEATURES.md (feature status)
- C:\Users\seanp\Workspace\WA_map\LESSONS.md (known patterns & gotchas)

### Step 4: Report Session Readiness
Provide a brief status report:
1. **Project**: Name and current completion percentage
2. **Active Work**: What's currently in progress per PLAN.md
3. **Open Bugs**: Count and highest severity from BUGS.md
4. **Known Gotchas**: Key patterns from LESSONS.md to avoid repeating
5. **Mandatory Behaviors**: Confirmed (list the 7)
6. **Ready for**: What type of work you're prepared to assist with

### Step 5: List Available Commands
Report all available slash commands for this project:

**Workflow Commands**:
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/wa-init` | Initialize session with governance compliance |
| `/wa-plan` | Create implementation plan before coding (§4) |
| `/wa-debug` | Hypothesis-driven bug investigation (§5) |
| `/wa-commit` | Documentation & Git workflow after changes (§6) |
| `/wa-reflect` | Lessons learned & structured reflection (§7) |
| `/wa-research` | Deep Research Protocol for complex issues (§10) |
| `/wa-bug` | Quick bug registration to BUGS.md |
| `/wa-feature-complete` | Complete feature with all mandatory actions |

### Reminder
Key Principle: "Prove before fixing, commit before changing, document before forgetting."

Answer the Four Questions before beginning any work:
1. What exists now?
2. What should exist?
3. How will we know we're done?
4. How do we undo this?
